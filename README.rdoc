= Property Catalog Manager

Originally submitted as an evaluation project for the EasyBroker apprentice dev program, this Ruby on Rails project showcases a prototype manager for a real estate catalog.  Users can create property records and upload pictures of them, as well as search through these records and assign them features from a list the user can manage.
